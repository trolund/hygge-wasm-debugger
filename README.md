# Getting Started with the Hygge Wasm Debugger

The Hygge Wasm Debugger is the implementation of the the Learning and Development tool proposed as part of the master thesis **Design and Implementation of a WebAssembly Compiler Back-End for the High-Level Programming Language Hygge** by Troels Lund.

The tool is designed to make it easy to load, run, and debug WebAssembly programs produced by the HyggeWasm compiler. The HyggeWasm compiler can be found [here](https://github.com/trolund/hyggeWasm)
